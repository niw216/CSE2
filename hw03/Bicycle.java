    /*This program allows users to enter the number of revolutions counted
    (henceforth, counts) for a 27in. diameter bicycle wheel, enter the amount of
    time passed in seconds, and compute & display the distance traveled in miles
    to three decimal places; minutes elapsed during the trip to 2 decimal places;
    and the average speed in miles per hour (mph) to one decimal place.    */
